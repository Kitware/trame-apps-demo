This trame based application let you drop your own images and run various AI models against them for classification, detection and similarity. Furthermore, several XAITK methods are expose for generating saliency map of those predictions.

## XAITK

The Explainable AI Toolkit (XAITK) contains a variety of tools and resources to help users, developers, and researchers understand complex machine learning models. The toolkit combines a searchable repository of independent contributions and a more integrated, common software framework. The toolkit was developed under the [Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence).

## XAITK - Saliency

The xaitk-saliency package is an open source, Explainable AI (XAI) framework for visual saliency algorithm interfaces and implementations, built for analytics and autonomy applications.

See [here](https://github.com/XAITK/xaitk-saliency#:~:text=See-,here,-for%20a%20more) for a more formal introduction to the topic of XAI and visual saliency explanations.

This framework is a part of the [Explainable AI Toolkit (XAITK)](https://xaitk.org/).

## Target Audience

This toolkit is intended to help data scientists and developers who want to add visual saliency explanations to their workflow or product. Functionality provided here is both directly accessible for targeted experimentation, and through Strategy and Adapter patterns to allow for modular integration into systems and applications.
