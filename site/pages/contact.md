Kitware has more than 20 years of experience developing and deploying cutting-edge solutions for customers ranging from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Our projects range from small, time-critical projects to long-term collaborations lasting many years, with budgets from tens of thousands to multi-millions of dollars. No matter your unique situation, Kitware can develop a custom solution tailored to your needs.

Weâ€™re known for our deep customer understanding, broad technical expertise, honest interactions, and innovative approach. Through our collaborative relationships with customers and open source communities, and our solid research experience, we are able to deliver innovative solutions to address even the most challenging R&D problems.

And while Kitware builds upon open innovation, we also respect the need for proprietary solutions due to competitive or regulatory restrictions. That means we are able to integrate our expertise and open source platforms into your products and processes, even if the end product must remain closed.
